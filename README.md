# Sign-Language

I have developed a sign language detection model leveraging OpenCV for image processing and Mediapipe for hand tracking. The model captures real-time video input, detects hand landmarks, and interprets sign language gestures with high accuracy. By integrating these powerful tools, our system offers an efficient and accessible solution for translating sign language into text or speech, enhancing communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.
